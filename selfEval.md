# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- I feel pretty confident with my fluency in comparison operators, but I definitely want to commit time to studying the lessons before class more regularly. Kim suggested this, and I think it's a good rhythm - read what we will go over, then go over it live, and then re-establish my knowledge with a third run-through independently.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- I am extremely confident with these because I am used to using these in formal logic from college.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- I could use some work on these just in terms of getting the syntax right without having to refer to past models.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- I spent about 2.5 hours on this lesson, but it flew by because we're really coding now and I find it extremely satisfying to get the results we're looking for, even if it takes me a while.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I don't think I need to adjust my calendar to do this because I'm lucky enough not to have to work right now, but I think I need to put significant time into increasing my typing speed.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I am wondering what our evaluations are going to look like once we have enough foundational knowledge for a test to make sense. I also wonder to what extent we are expected to rely on ourselves for answers as in conventional education, versus our ability to seek out solutions with resources available such as notes or search engines, since that seems to mirror the professional environment we are going to enter into.
